// CrawlFileTree crawls the file system subtree rooted at directory "rootdir".
// For each file that it encounters, it scans the file to test whether it
// contains ASCII text data.  If so, it indexes the file.
//
// Arguments:
//
// - rootdir: the directory that should serve as the root of the crawl.
//
// Returns:
//
// - doctable: an output parameter through which a DocTable is returned.
//   All indexed files are represented in the DocTable.
//
// - index: an output parameter through which an inverted index (i.e.,
//   a MemIndex) is returned.  All indexed files are represented in
//   the inverted index.
//
// - returns 0 on failure (nothing is allocated), 1 on success.
